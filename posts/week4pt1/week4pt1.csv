0,Trending Topics Drivers,0,Sheryl Piechocki,Sheryl Piechocki,"Understanding drivers for trending topics could help determine ways to deal with the spread of misinformation.  The study referenced in the link below concerns COVID-19 and the trending topic that 5G is a cause.  The goal of the study was to look for the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 theory.
In this study, Twitter data in the U.K. with the #5GCoronavirus hashtag from March 27, 2020 to April 4, 2020 was collected.  Influential users were determined using graph clusters and nodes were ranked by betweenness centrality score.  Results showed two large networks.  One was a group of isolates (users who tweet without any mentions) and the other was a broadcast group (users whose tweets led to retweets).  A detailed look at some sample tweets revealed that 65.2% were actually non-supporters of the theory.  So, even though it became a trending topic, the majority  did not believe the theory that 5G causes COVID-19.  In addition, a single Twitter account created only to spread the theory was discovered.  No corresponding account to counter the theory was found.  The authors believe that users tweeting about the topic jokingly were a major driver in spreading the theory.  They propose that an authority or public figure Twitter account actively combating the theory would reduce its spread.  They also feel that users should not re-tweet or tweet even in jest, but rather should report it in order to avoid it gaining trending status.  (They go on to say that Twitter could then shut down the spread.  The topic of whether Twitter and other social media sites should remove content is  a whole other discussion. )

8,News Articles,0,Mikhail Kollontai,Mikhail Kollontai,"In this day of sensationalized news it is often very interesting to trace the life of a story. For the more reputable sources it usually starts with a significant amount of leg work, primary research and in-depth interviews. Publications with integrity will wait until they have at least 3 independent sources corroborating a story before publishing. 
Newer media, however, does not hold to these lofty standards. A story you see on some news channels will at times be the result of a ""reporter"" seeing a tweet or a blog post and running with the story. Little or no fact-checking is done since the point of the story is internet traffic, not educating the consumer. With social media such stories can get caught up in a retweet or repost craze that spreads the story far and wide with many of the readers not even questioning the validity of the information. 
I can envision a system that scrapes news articles for quotes, headlines, punchlines (basically key predictors) and developing networks of connected stories to identify trends in the way sources/information are reused. These networks could then be analyzed to identify echo chambers  as well as islands of diversified information. The business goal of such an endeavor would be to provide an objective evaluation of the quality of sourcing used by a news organization. Each network would be scored based on the connections it maintains and the sources it uses.","June 24, 2020 3:28:31 PM EDT"

10,Identifying Breast Cancer Trends,0,Amber Ferger,Amber Ferger,"I came across a really interesting article by Jurca, Addam, Aksac, Gao, Ozyer, Demetrick, and Alhajj titled ""Integrating Text Mining, Data Mining, and Network Analysis for Identifying Genetic Breast Cancer Trends"" that is a great example of the convergence of text mining and social network analytics.
The Problem: Literature containing information about biomarkers that are indicative of breast cancer is non-standardized and unstructured, making it difficult to process in large quantities. Although research papers contain a trove of information, the sheer volume of it makes sifting through relevant articles a very tedious task. 
The Goal: Utilize natural language processing and text mining techniques to extract relevant information from the research papers. Identify key relationships between entities and terms through the use of social network analytic techniques. 
The Added Bonus: By combining NLP and text mining techniques with social network analysis, the authors of the study were able to identify functional relationships (like those between different genes) and associative relationships (like those between authors in different geographic regions). The functional relationships are important for understanding the disease itself, which has obvious benefits. However, the identification of associative relationships provided a much different set of insights -- how the discoveries themselves varied by region and time. 
Sources of Data: The papers were sourced from PubMed based on a keyword search. The authors then performed entity extraction using open-source dictionaries (ex: becas, uniprot, hcnc) to identify important terms in each text, such as those related to specific genes and proteins. Once complete, they were able to bucket similar papers based on terms and analyze the text and relationships accordingly. Geographic relationships were extracted based on the address of the authors in the paper. 
I think this is a really neat application of the merging of 2 different analytical techniques to derive insights into the disease itself and the discoveries around it!","June 22, 2020 9:00:50 PM EDT"

We all might be aware of Covid-19. Finding the medicine for Covid-19 became a biggest challenge because of the change in classifications for the disease.
Generally for finding a drug for a diease involves lot of analysis, tests but most important is identifying the root cause and what the disease is impacting. In some cases what kind of drug will help cure/kill the diseases cells.
One example is using obesity and psoriasis as examples by analyzing the frequency of disease-related MeSH terms in PubMed abstracts over time.Network Analysis and Text mining is used to predict emerging trends at a relatively early stage and we analyze the literature-identified genes for genetic associations, druggability, and biological pathways to explore any potential biological connections between the two diseases that could be utilized for drug discovery.

18,Text Processing (Google Searches) and Network Data Analysis,0,Zachary Alexander,Zachary Alexander,"The New York Times posted an OpEd article in early April titled, ""Google Searches Can Help Us Find Emerging COVID-19 Outbreaks"", that highlighted a data scientist's approach to mapping out the spread of COVID-19 throughout the world by mining Google's search data. Through keyword and text analysis for spikes in searches such as ""I can't smell"", or ""my eyes hurt"", or specific searches related to fevers, chills, etc. in multiple languages, the author was able to pinpoint emerging hotspots around the same time the confirmed case counts rose in those areas. It's been mentioned before, but Google search term analysis has continued to intrigue data scientists for years, since Google is typically a private way for humans to search the web without having to consult with other people. In this context, it's providing insight into people's anxiety about the virus, and could even help predict where case counts will rise before they actually happen. On top of this, I think it would be interesting to incorporate networks into this type of analysis -- since searches can be subsetted by location and time, networks and graphs could be used to help map the ebbs and flows of those being exposed to the virus. Additionally, based on certain spikes in search terms, it would be interesting to attach edge weights or node attributes that help measure the severity of the hotspots and the trends in Google searches by people in those areas.
Business Goals - the obvious goals of this would be to provide analysis or a visualization tool that could be used to help map and predict where new hotspots are emerging before they actually happen. If there do appear to be trends in searches based on these factors, this could help government officials and local entities combat the virus before it reaches it's full potential in a given hotspot.  
Potential Sources of Data - Google Search Terms and any other Google-related keyword searching data. This could also be expanded out to different social networks, i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc., but would possible fall a bit more outside of the scope of traditional text processing.","June 25, 2020 6:53:26 PM EDT"

One could map a graph of cases defended by particular law firms and their outcomes in order to identify which firms have been more succesful dealing with particular types of cases.

22,Use of NLP and network analysis techniques to describe the network of drug cartels in Mexico,0,Subhalaxmi Rout,Subhalaxmi Rout,"Focusing on Mexican cartels and affiliated drug trafficking organizations examines how self-proclaimed cartel members use social media to further the criminal activities of their organizations. Researchers collected data of alleged cartel members over a period of 4 months from social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc). After data collection ended, quantitative, qualitative, and social network analysis were performed to identify how subjects made use of Facebook to assert their cartel/ drug trafficking organization (DTO) affiliations, how they communicated with others, and how they were connected to one another. Results indicated that cartel members actively use Facebook to plan, organize, and communicate in real-time.
Business Goal: Identifying and observing online behavior of self-identified members of Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Additional research in this area is needed to further understand the behavior of cartel members on social media and to validate their use of these platforms to further their criminal activities.
Potential sources of data: The research methodology called for identifying potential drug trafficking organization (DTO) members on social media, systematically gathering information from their posts, and then analyzing the resulting data using descriptive, qualitative, and social network analytic techniques.

To understand the reasons behind, a social scientist used natural language processing, network analysis, and a social media application to analyze how cultural bridges shaped public discourse about autism spectrum disorders on Facebook over the course of 1.5 years, controlling for various characteristics of advocacy organizations, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. The study shows that organizations that create substantial cultural bridges provoke 2.52 times more comments about their messages from new social media users than those that do not, controlling for these factors. It offers a theory of cultural messaging and public deliberation and computational techniques for text analysis and application-based survey research.

Business Goal: Equip book publishers with a tool/model that enables them to identify topics of high interest to the American people and authors to reach out to write the books. 
   


Approach:


     1. Identify topics that are of... 
   


      highest interest (threshold to-be-determined) across America 
    

      identify if a lot or a little (threshold to-be determined) has been written already about the topic 
    



     2. Identify authors that... 
   


      have expertise (criteria to-be-determined) in the topics identified 
    



      have an expansive (threshold to-be-determined) social network 
    



     3. Marry steps 1 and 2 together to identify books to write and authors to write them 
   


Potential sources of data:


Topics:


     1. Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc...) posts 
   

     2. Main-stream media headlines and articles 
   


Authors:


     3. New York Times and other best seller lists
